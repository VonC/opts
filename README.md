# opts

The **v1** release is coming soon!

---

**A low friction command-line interface library for Go (golang)**

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/opts?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/opts)  [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/jpillora/opts.svg?style=shield&circle-token=69ef9c6ac0d8cebcb354bb85c377eceff77bfb1b)](https://circleci.com/gh/jpillora/opts)

Command-line parsing should be easy. Use configuration structs:

``` go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/jpillora/opts"
)

func main() {
	config := struct {
		File  string `help:"file to load"`
		Lines int    `help:"number of lines to show"`
	}{}
	opts.Parse(&config)
	fmt.Println(config)
}
```

```sh
$ go build -o my-prog
$ ./my-prog --help
  Usage: my-prog [options]

  Options:
  --file, -f   file to load
  --lines, -l  number of lines to show
  --help, -h

```

```sh
$ ./my-prog -f foo -l 12
{foo 12}
```

### Features (with examples)

* Easy to use ([simple](example/simple/))
* Promotes separation of CLI code and library code ([separation](example/separation/))
* Automatically generated `--help` text via struct tags `help:"Foo bar"` ([help](example/help/))
* Commands by nesting structs ([cmds](example/cmds/))
* Default values by modifying the struct prior to `Parse()` ([defaults](example/defaults/))
* Default values from a JSON config file, unmarshalled via your config struct ([config](example/config/))
* Default values from environment, defined by your field names ([env](example/env/))
* Infers program name from executable name
* Infers sub-command names from package name
* Extensible via `flag.Value` ([customtypes](example/customtypes/))
* Customizable help text by modifying the default templates ([customhelp](example/customhelp/))
* Built-in auto-completion

### Overview

Internally, `opts` creates `flag.FlagSet`s from your configuration structs using `pkg/reflect`. So, given the following configuration:

```go
type Config struct {
	Alpha   string        `help:"a string"`
	Bravo   int           `help:"an int"`
	Charlie bool          `help:"a bool"`
	Delta   time.Duration `help:"a duration"`
}

c := Config{
	Bravo: 42,
	Delta: 2 * time.Minute,
}
```

When we perform a `opts.Parse`:

```go
opts.Parse(&c)
```

Under the hood, `opts` will *approximately* perform:

```go
set := flag.NewFlagSet("config")
set.StringVar(&c.Alpha, "", "a string")
set.IntVar(&c.Bravo, 42, "an int")
set.BoolVar(&c.Charlie, false, "a bool")
set.DurationVar(&c.Delta, 2 * time.Minute, "a duration")
set.Parse(os.Args)
```

However `opts` also does **much more**, like giving you pretty `--help` output:

```
$ ./foo --help

  Usage: foo [options]

  Options:
  --alpha, -a    a string
  --bravo, -b    an int (default 42)
  --charlie, -c  an bool
  --delta, -d    a duration (default 2m0s)
  --help, -h

```

### Struct Tag API

**opts** tries to set sane defaults so, for the most part, you'll get the desired behaviour by simply providing a configuration struct.

However, you can customise this behaviour by providing the `opts` struct
tag with a series of settings in the form of `key=value`:

```
`opts:"key=value,key=value,..."
```

Where `key` must be:

* `name` - Name is used to display the field in the help text (defaults to the field name converted to lowercase and dashes)

* `help` - Help is used to describe the field

	Note: The `help` setting is only setting that can also be set as a
	stand-alone struct tag: `help:"my text goes here"`. You must use the stand-alone tag if you wish to use `=` and `,` in your help string.

* `type` - The type assigned the field (defaults using the table below)

	Where `value` must be one of:

	* `flag` - The field will be treated as a flag. That is, an optional, named, configurable field. Set using `./program --flag-name <flag-value>`.

	* `arg` - The field will be treated as an argument. That is, a required, positional, unamed, configurable field. Set using `./program <argument-value>`.

	* `args` - The field will be treated as an argument list. Set using `./program <argument-value>`.

	* `cmd` - 	A command is nested `opts.Opt` instance, so its fields behave in exactly the same way as the parent struct.

		You can access the options of a command with `prog --prog-opt X cmd --cmd-opt Y`

		Restricted to fields with Go type `struct`.

	* `cmdname` - 	A special type which will assume the name of the selected command

		Restricted to fields with Go type `string`.

	* `embedded` - 	A special type which causes the fields of struct to be used in the current struct. Useful if you want to split your command-line options across multiple files.

		Restricted to fields with Go type `struct`.

	All fields must have a **opts** `type`. By default a struct field will be assigned a `type` depending on its field type:

  | Go Type         | Default opts `type` |      Valid `type`s       |
  | --------------- | :-----------------: | :----------------------: |
  | `int`           |       `flag`        |      `flag`, `arg`       |
  | `string`        |       `flag`        | `flag`, `arg`, `cmdname` |
  | `bool`          |       `flag`        |      `flag`, `arg`       |
  | `flag.Value`    |       `flag`        |      `flag`, `arg`       |
  | `time.Duration` |       `flag`        |      `flag`, `arg`       |
  | `[]string`      |       `flag`        |      `flag`, `args`      |
  | `struct`        |     `embedded`      |    `cmd`, `embedded`     |


* `short` - One or two letters to be used a flags "short" name. Only valid when `type` is `flag`.

* `env` - An environent variable to use as the field's **default** value. It can always be overridden by providing the appropriate flag.

	For example, `opts:"env=FOO"`. It can also be infered using the field name with simply `opts:"env"`. You can enable inference on all flags with the `opts.Opts` method `UseEnv()`.

### Other projects

Other CLI libraries which infer flags from struct tags:

* https://github.com/alexflint/go-arg Doesn't support subcommands
* https://github.com/jessevdk/go-flags Has many features though still no subcommands

### Todo

* More tests
* Multiple short options `-aux` (Requires a non-`pkg/flag` parser)
