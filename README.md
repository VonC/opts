# opts

The **v1** release is coming soon!

---

**A low friction command-line interface library for Go (golang)**

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/opts?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/opts)  [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/jpillora/opts.svg?style=shield&circle-token=69ef9c6ac0d8cebcb354bb85c377eceff77bfb1b)](https://circleci.com/gh/jpillora/opts)

Command-line parsing should be easy. Use configuration structs:

``` go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/jpillora/opts"
)

func main() {
	config := struct {
		File  string `help:"file to load"`
		Lines int    `help:"number of lines to show"`
	}{}
	opts.Parse(&config)
	log.Printf("%+v", config)
}
```

```sh
$ go build -o my-prog
$ ./my-prog --help
  Usage: my-prog [options]

  Options:
  --file, -f   file to load
  --lines, -l  number of lines to show
  --help, -h

```

```sh
$ ./my-prog -f foo -l 12
{File:foo Lines:42}
```

### Features (with examples)

* Easy to use ([simple](example/simple/))
* Promotes separation of CLI code and library code ([separation](example/separation/))
* Automatically generated `--help` text via struct tags `help:"Foo bar"` ([help](example/help/))
* Commands by nesting structs ([cmds](example/cmds/))
* Default values by modifying the struct prior to `Parse()` ([defaults](example/defaults/))
* Default values from a JSON config file, unmarshalled via your config struct ([config](example/config/))
* Default values from environment, defined by your field names ([env](example/env/))
* Infers program name from executable name
* Infers sub-command names from package name
* Extensible via `flag.Value` ([customtypes](example/customtypes/))
* Customizable help text by modifying the default templates ([customhelp](example/customhelp/))
* Built-in shell auto-completion

### Struct Tag API

**opts** tries to set sane defaults so, for the most part, you'll get the desired behaviour by simply providing a configuration struct.

However, you can customise this behaviour by providing the `opts` struct
tag with a series of settings in the form of **`key=value`**:

```
`opts:"key=value,key=value,..."
```

Where **`key`** must be:

* `-` (dash) - Like `json:"-"`, the dash character will cause opts to ignore the struct field. Note, unexported fields are always ignored.

* `name` - Name is used to display the field in the help text. By default, the flag name is infered by converting the struct field name to lowercase and adding dashes between words.

* `short` - One or two letters to be used a flag's "short" name. By default, the first letter of `name` will be used. It will remain unset if there is a duplicate short name. Only valid when `type` is `flag`.

* `help` - The help text used to describe the field. It will be displayed next to the flag name in the help output.

	**Note:** `help` is the only setting that can also be set as a
	stand-alone struct tag (i.e. `help:"my text goes here"`). You must use the stand-alone tag if you wish to use `"`, `=` or `,` in your help string.

* `env` - An environent variable to use as the field's **default** value. It can always be overridden by providing the appropriate flag.

	For example, `opts:"env=FOO"`. It can also be infered using the field name with simply `opts:"env"`. You can enable inference on all flags with the `opts.Opts` method `UseEnv()`.

* `type` - The type assigned the field

	All fields will be given a **opts** `type`. By default a struct field will be assigned a `type` depending on its field type:

  | Go Type             | Default opts `type` |      Valid `type`s       |
  | ------------------- | :-----------------: | :----------------------: |
  | flag-value type     |       `flag`        |      `flag`, `arg`       |
  | `[]`flag-value type |       `flag`        |      `flag`, `arg`       |
  | `string`            |       `flag`        | `flag`, `arg`, `cmdname` |
  | `struct`            |     `embedded`      |    `cmd`, `embedded`     |

	Notes:

	* A flag-value type is any of: `string`, `bool`, `int{8-64}`, `uint{8-64}`, `float{32-64}`, `time.Duration`, `flag.Value`
	* All flag-value types can also be a slice, which enables multiple flag parsing. For example, `--foo 1 --foo 2` could result in `[]int{1,2}`.

	Where **`value`** must be one of:

	* `flag` - The field will be treated as a flag. That is, an optional, named, configurable field. Set using `./program --flag-name <flag-value>`.

	* `arg` - The field will be treated as an argument. That is, a required, positional, unamed, configurable field. Set using `./program <argument-value>`.

	* `args` - The field will be treated as an argument list. Set using `./program <argument-value>`.

	* `cmd` - A command is nested `opts.Opt` instance, so its fields behave in exactly the same way as the parent struct.

		You can set the flags of a command "`cmd`" with:
		
		```
		prog --prog-opt X cmd --cmd-opt Y
		```

		Restricted to fields with Go type `struct`.

	* `cmdname` - A special type which will assume the name of the selected command

		Restricted to fields with Go type `string`.

	* `embedded` - A special type which causes the fields of struct to be used in the current struct. Useful if you want to split your command-line options across multiple files.

		Restricted to fields with Go type `struct`.
